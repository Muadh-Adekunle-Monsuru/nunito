# React Rive Animation Project

This is a simple React project that incorporates animations using Rive. The animation was inspired by a UI design concept found on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/16532682-Nunito-Hero-header-v-2).

## Features

- **React Integration:** Built with React for component-based UI development.
- **Rive Animations:** Smooth, high-quality animations created and controlled using Rive.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is designed to be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.
- Basic knowledge of React and Rive animations.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-rive-animation.git
   cd react-rive-animation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the animation in action.

## Usage
